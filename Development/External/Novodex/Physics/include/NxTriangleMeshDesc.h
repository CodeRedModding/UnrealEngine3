	When a triangle mesh collides with another object, a material is required at the collision point.

	Otherwise, if the point of contact is on a triangle with index i, then the material index is determined as: 
	NxMaterialIndex	index = *(NxMaterialIndex *)(((NxU8*)materialIndices) + materialIndexStride * i);

	is that it is assumed to be semi-infinite along one axis, and therefore it doesn't have the problem
	of fast moving objects 'popping' through it due to temporal under sampling.

	However, height fields must be 'flat' in the sense that the projections of all triangles onto the
	height field plane must be disjoint. (If the height field vertical axis is Y, the height field plane is spanned by X and Z.)

	To create a height field, set heightFieldVerticalAxis to NX_X, NX_Y or NX_Z,

	In this way even objects which are under the surface of the height field but above
	this cutoff are treated as colliding with the height field. To create a height field with the up axis being
	the Y axis, you need to set the heightFieldVerticalAxis to Y and the heightFieldVerticalExtent to a large negative number. 

	The heightFieldVerticalExtent has to be outside of the vertex coordinate range of the mesh along the heightFieldVerticalAxis.

	You may set this to a positive value, in which case the extent will be cast along the opposite side of the height field.

	You may use a smaller finite value for the extent if you want to put some space under the height field, such as a cave.
