				to infinity then the motor will keep speeding up, unless there is some sort of resistance
				on the attached bodies. The sign of this variable determines the rotation direction,
				with positive values going the same way as positive joint angles.
				Default is infinity.

				Default is 0, should be >= 0. Setting this to a very large value if velTarget is also 
				very large may not be a good idea.
