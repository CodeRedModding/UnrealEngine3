How to make an RPM distribution of Tex2RTF
==================================================

You can make the RPM with standard commands: first make source tarball 
with zipsrc.sh and then run 

    rpm -ta tex2rtf-2.01-source.tar.bz2 

to create both tex2rtf-2.01-1.src.rpm and tex2rtf-2.01-1.$(arch).rpm

This builds the Tex2RTF binary using wxBase.

Note that the 2.01 binaries have been built in completely
different ways right now :-(

The RPM has been built with wxBase, and the .tar.gz
distribution has been built using wxGTK (but with no
UI). All command-line versions should be built
with wxBase in future, since the wxBase one is
smaller.
