 *   won't block. This event is generated only once, when the connection is
 *   first established, and then only if a call failed with GSOCK_WOULDBLOCK,
 *   when the output buffer empties again. This means that the app should
 *   assume that it can write since the first OUTPUT event, and no more
 *   OUTPUT events will be generated unless an error occurs.
 * GSOCK_CONNECTION:
 *   Connection succesfully established, for client sockets, or incoming
 *   client connection, for server sockets. Wait for this event (also watch
 *   out for GSOCK_LOST) after you issue a nonblocking GSocket_Connect() call.
 * GSOCK_LOST:
 *   The connection is lost (or a connection request failed); this could
 *   be due to a failure, or due to the peer closing it gracefully.
