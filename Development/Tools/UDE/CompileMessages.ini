[Warning Description]
Warning001=You declared a class variable with the same name as a class variable of a superclass. This will obscure the variable in the superclass so you can't access it in the code of your class anymore.
Warning002=A function declares a local variable but doesn't use it beyond that.  You may as well remove it.
Warning003=The function is declared as returning a value, but there's no return statement in the function. The default value of that variable type will be returned (e.g. false, 0, "", None)
Warning004=You are using a variable marked as deprecated in your code.
Warning005=Usually these errors are caused by missing files or typos. Check the spelling of the file name and make sure the file really is where filename points to. Remember that the GameName\MyMod directory is the base for specifying file names in #exec lines.
Warning006=Usually these errors are caused by missing files or typos. Check the spelling of the file name and make sure the file really is where filename points to. Remember that the GameName\MyMod directory is the base for specifying file names in #exec lines.
Warning007=The package you specified in an #exec obj load line could not be found. Check the spelling of the file name.
Warning008=Generally caused by a missing file for the mesh. Check for typos and check the log for details about which file is missing.
Warning009=Generally caused by a missing file for the mesh. Check for typos and check the log for details about which file is missing.
Warning010=Generally caused by a missing file for the mesh. Check for typos and check the log for details about which file is missing.
Warning011=Generally caused by a missing file for the mesh. Check for typos and check the log for details about which file is missing.
Warning012=Generally caused by a missing file for the mesh. Check for typos and check the log for details about which file is missing.  This error can also be caused by a missing texture. Make sure the texture is either imported or the texture's package is loaded before assigning it to a mesh.
Warning013=Pretty self explanatory.  The dimensions must be in powers of two.
Warning014=Usually shows up with a dimension error.  The file couldn't import.

[Error Declaration]
Error001=Unknown property in defaults:%s
Error002=Bad class definition '%s'
Error003=Superclass %s of class %s not found
Error004=Unexpected end of script in '%s' block
Error005=Error, Missing '{' in %s
Error006=Error, Unexpected end of file at end of Class
Error007=Call to '%s': type mismatch in parameter 
Error008=Type mismatch in '%s'
Error009=Call to '%s': Bad ',' or missing ')'
Error010='%s': Bad command or expression
Error011=Missing '%s' in '%s'
Error012=Unexpected '%s'
Error013=Unexpected end of '%s' in '%s' block
Error014=Unterminated string constant
Error015=redundant data: %s

[Error Description]
Error001=Either the variable is not declared or there are spaces around the "=".
Error002=In later Unreal Engine builds (like Unreal II or UT2003), the most common cause for this error is that you accidentally used "expands" instead of "extends." The old keyword "expands" is not supported anymore. (It has been considered deprecated for a long while already.)
Error003=The superclass of one of your classes couldn't be found. Check the class header of the second class for typos. If the superclass is in the same package also check its class header, if not check your ini files' EditPackages lines for missing packages.
Error004=This is usually caused by one or more missing "}". This error can be quite annoying in large classes. Most of it is prevented by proper code indentation and (what experienced coders frequently do) writing both the opening and the closing brace at the same time and then filling in code between them.
Error005=This is caused by one or more missing "{" or too many "}". This error can be quite annoying in large classes. Most of it is prevented by proper code indentation and (what experienced coders frequently do) writing both the opening and the closing brace at the same time and then filling in code between them.
Error006=This is usually caused by one or more missing "}". This error can be quite annoying in large classes. Most of it is prevented by proper code indentation and (what experienced coders frequently do) writing both the opening and the closing brace at the same time and then filling in code between them.
Error007=One of the parameters in your function call doesn't have the right type and can't be automatically casted to it. Look up the original declaration of the function and double-check against the types of the values you're actually using.
Error008=The variable type you specified doesn't match the type the operator requires and can't be automatically casted to the required type.
Error009=You are either passing in too many variables to the function, or you are missing the end ')'.
Error010=There is something syntactically wrong with this statement.  (Like an else without an if for example).
Error011=You were missing a character in your declaration.  Probably a '(' or a ')'.
Error012=Something was encountered where it wasn't expected to be.  This can be cause by having the wrong number of or mismatched curly braces.
Error013=You opened or started a block of code (with an 'if', a 'switch', or something) and never properly terminated it with '}' (possibly never started the block either with a '{' as well)
Error014=This error occurs when the closing double quotation marks for a string are missing. Note that while strings may contain line breaks, they may not span several lines in your code. Use the Chr function to generate the line break characters if you need them.
Error015=You get this error when you redefine the value of a defaultproperty within the same class. (ie there is more than one instance of this variable in defaultproperties so it becomes redundant)
